      "question": "What is artificial general intelligence (AGI)?",
      "answer": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to a type of AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. Unlike narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, AGI is capable of general problem-solving and learning."
    },
    {
      "category": "General AI",
      "question": "What is the Turing Test?",
      "answer": "The Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing, is a test for determining whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. It is a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit human-like intelligence."
    },
    {
      "category": "Machine Learning",
      "question": "What is overfitting in machine learning?",
      "answer": "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns not only the underlying pattern in the training data but also the noise. As a result, the model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data."
    },
    {
      "category": "Machine Learning",
      "question": "What is cross-validation?",
      "answer": "Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a machine learning model by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets. The model is trained on some subsets and tested on others, helping to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data."
    },
    {
      "category": "Deep Learning",
      "question": "What is the vanishing gradient problem?",
      "answer": "The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients of a neural network's loss function become very small during backpropagation, causing the weights in the earlier layers to stop updating. This leads to poor learning in deep networks."
    },
    {
      "category": "Deep Learning",
      "question": "What is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)?",
      "answer": "A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network designed for sequence prediction tasks. It has loops that allow information to persist, making it suitable for tasks such as language modeling and time-series forecasting."
    },
    {
      "category": "AI Solutions",
      "question": "How can AI improve supply chain management?",
      "answer": "AI can optimize supply chain management by predicting demand, optimizing inventory levels, automating warehouse operations, and improving route planning, all of which lead to cost savings and improved efficiency."
    },
    {
      "category": "AI Solutions",
      "question": "What is the role of AI in cybersecurity?",
